# Domain Name System (DNS)

We know about IP addresses that enable every machine to connect with other machines. But as we know humans are more comfortable with names than numbers. It's easier to remember a name like `google.com` than something like `122.250.192.232`.

This brings us to Domain Name System (DNS) which is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system used for translating human-readable domain names to IP addresses.

## How DNS works

When we aim to reach `example.com` from our browser, we act as the user, and the server holds the desired information.

DNS lookup entails eight steps, orchestrated through interactions among four distinct components:


### Components:

1. DNS Resolver
2. DNS Root Name Server
3. TLD(Top Level Domain eg. .com .org) Name Server
4. Authoritative Name Server

### Workflows...

DNS lookup involves the following eight steps:

1. A client types `example.com` into a web browser, the query travels to the internet and is received by a DNS resolver.
2. The resolver then recursively queries a DNS root nameserver.
3. The root server responds to the resolver with the address of a Top-Level Domain (TLD).
4. The resolver then makes a request to the .com TLD.
5. The TLD server then responds with the IP address of the domain's nameserver, `example.com`.
6. Lastly, the recursive resolver sends a query to the domain's nameserver.
7. The IP address for `example.com` is then returned to the resolver from the nameserver.
8. The DNS resolver then responds to the web browser with the IP address of the domain requested initially.

Once the IP address has been resolved, the client should be able to request content from the resolved IP address. For example, the resolved IP may return a webpage to be rendered in the browser.
