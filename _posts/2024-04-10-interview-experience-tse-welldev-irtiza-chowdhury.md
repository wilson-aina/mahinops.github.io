## Background

I hail from a background in biochemistry and molecular biology, supplemented by two years of experience as an executive in R&D at ACME. During my time at SUST, I encountered a requirement for all departments to include at least one non-major course in computer science. This led me to delve into programming, starting with a course in C and advancing to a Python course during my master's studies. As I explored various websites, I found myself drawn to the idea of creating websites akin to those I admired. This sparked a keen interest in learning more about web development and seeking out resources and guidance.

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic forced us to adapt to utilizing online resources more effectively. Witnessing the proliferation of online courses, I found myself questioning whether my current role at ACME was the right fit for me. The physical demands outweighed the mental stimulation I craved, as I inherently lean towards mental tasks over physical labor due to my inclination towards laziness.

My curiosity led me to explore the standards of the pharmaceutical industry in Bangladesh, and I was disheartened to discover a significant disparity compared to international benchmarks. This prompted me to investigate the IT standards of Bangladesh, where I found solace in the realization that the standards remained consistent for skilled individuals. Eager to enhance my skills, I embarked on a journey of self-improvement, discovering popular and beginner-friendly instructors through online platforms like YouTube. Following their guidance, I diligently honed my skill set day by day.


## Interview Phases

I underwent three interview phases, all of which predominantly focused on JavaScript, given my expertise in the language. However, when asked about my knowledge of databases, I admitted my lack thereof.


### Interview Phase-1 (Technical)
The first phase lasted approximately 1.10 hours and commenced with a brief introduction to the HR representative. Common questions regarding my strengths, weaknesses, educational background, and salary expectations were discussed. Then, the technical segment began, covering topics such as:

1. How to sort an array?
2. The sort method can have a callback function. So what will be the result without any callback function?
3. In the callback function, how callback functions react based on the return value?
4. How does the box model react?
5. What is the hierarchy of box-model in css?
6. What are the values of the position properties in css?
7. Difference between position relative and position absolute?
8. How do they react?
9. How can we get a single value from an array.?
10. How can we get a total value of the properties from an array?

And some basic questions about the css background.


### Interview Phase-2 (Technical)
This phase began with a basic introduction before delving into technical inquiries, which included:

1. How can we find the total value from an array?
2. As i replied the reduce method and reduce also receives a callback function, which recieves two parameters, current value and total value and a starting value. So what will be the result if we don't give any starting value?
3. How callback function travers the array properties?
4. How can we find an object from an array?
5. How many types of data are present in js?
6. What is the type of object?
7. What is the promise in js?
8.What are the asynchronous functions in js?
9. Example of a promise use case. 
10. Event loop.
11. Get an object from an array of objects?


### Interview Phase-3 (Technical+Behavioural)

This phase primarily consisted of discussions to gauge my motivation level. The interviewer delved into understanding my motivations and concluded with a task aimed at demonstrating my motivation and suitability for the role. Additionally, there were detailed discussions on the functionality of various JavaScript functions and concepts.

### Interview Phase-4 (HR Round)

The HR round involved confirmation of the job offer and subsequent negotiations, where I received a call from the HR department.
