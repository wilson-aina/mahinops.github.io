## Background
I am from biochemistry and molecular biology. I also had 2 years of experience as an executive in R&d in ACME. 

In SUST, all the departments must have at least one cse non major course. We had a course on c and in masters a Python course. So from that time, I started to enjoy programming and looking for resources. When I browsed any websites I feel strong willingness to build websites like them. So I was searching for the resources and guidelines to learn. 

In the covid situation, we learnt how to use online resources more efficiently and we have seen so many centers started online courses and it was increasing day by day. I was in the ACME at the time of the 2nd wave of covid. I felt this job was not for me. There is so much physical load more than mental work. But I love to think and prefer mental work then physical work as I am kind of a lazy person. 

I searched the standards of the pharma of BD and the comparison between the standards of BD with the foreign countries. There is so much gap. Then I tried to know about the IT standards of BD. I got more motivated to see the standards are the same for skilled persons. Then I tried to find some online courses and found one. Day by day I came to know so many popular and beginner friendly instructors and their videos on YouTube. Followed their guidelines and tried to shine my skill set.


## Interview Phases

I faced 3 interview phases. All the round the interviewers focused on the JavaScript. As I know only the JS. They asked if I knew anything about DB, but I replied no. 


### Interview Phase-1 (Technical)
It took around 1.10 hours. It started with my intro to HR and some common questions like my strengths and weaknesses, educational background, about my family. What was my expected salary etc? 

Then we went to the technical round. As far as I remember, the questions were_
1. How to sort an array?
2. The sort method can have a callback function. So what will be the result without any callback function?
3. In the callback function, how callback functions react based on the return value?
4. How does the box model react?
5. What is the hierarchy of box-model in css?
6. What are the values of the position properties in css?
7. Difference between position relative and position absolute?
8. How do they react?
9. How can we get a single value from an array.?
10. How can we get a total value of the properties from an array?

And some basic questions about the css background.


### Interview Phase-2 (Technical)
It started with the basic introduction.Then we went to the technical round.
1. How can we find the total value from an array?
2. As i replied the reduce method and reduce also receives a callback function, which recieves two parameters, current value and total value and a starting value. So what will be the result if we don't give any starting value?
3. How callback function travers the array properties?
4. How can we find an object from an array?
5. How many types of data are present in js?
6. What is the type of object?
7. What is the promise in js?
8.What are the asynchronous functions in js?
9. Example of a promise use case. 
10. Event loop.
11. Get an object from an array of objects?


### Interview Phase-3 (Technical+Behavioural)

There was mainly discussion and the interviewer mainly tried to understand my motivation level. And there was a task at last to try to convince him that I am highly motivated and I am the right person and deserving of a chance. Of Course there was so much discussion of why and how every function works. So that's it.


### Interview Phase-4 (HR Round)

I received a call from the HR department regarding my job confirmation and negotiations.
