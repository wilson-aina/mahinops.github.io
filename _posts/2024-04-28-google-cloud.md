Now to understand how google cloud can help in the above business scenario, we need to know the resources of google cloud. Lets try understanding them one by one_

### What is Cloud Computing? 

The delivery of a shared pool of on-demand computing services over the public internet, that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. 


#### The 5 Characteristics of Cloud 

1. **On-deman Self Service** - Provision resources automatically without requiring human interaction. 
2. **Broad Network Access** - Available over the network. 
3. **Resource Pooling** - Pooled resources to support a multi-tenant model allowing multiple customers to share the same applications or the same physical infrastructure. 
4. **Rapid Elasticity** - Rapidly provision and de-provision any of the cloud computing resources. 
5. **Measured Service** - Resource usage can be monitored, controlled and reported using metering capabilities. 



### Cloud Deployment Models

1. Public Cloud - Offered over the public internet. Ex- GCP, AWS
2. Private Cloud - On-Premise and restricts business from public access and follows 5 characteristics of cloud. Google Cloud has Anthos, AWS had AWS Outposts.
3. Multi Cloud - AWS+GCP+Azure
4. Hybrid Cloud - Public Cloud+Private Cloud

**Hybrid Environment** - On-Premise data center + Public Cloud.
